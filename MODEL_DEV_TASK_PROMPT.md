# Automated Actuarial Model Development Task

**Task Frequency:** Every 12 hours  
**Repository:** https://github.com/wilson37wu/AI_Actuarial_2026_ver_Codex
**State File:** `.claude-dev/MODEL_DEV_STATE.json`  
**Email Recipient:** wilson.cuhk.ifa@gmail.com (update below)

---

## STARTUP: Load Session Context (2 min)

**CRITICAL:** Before doing any development work, execute these steps in order:

### Step 1: Read State File
```
Read and parse: .claude-dev/MODEL_DEV_STATE.json
```

Extract these values into working memory:
- `current_phase` → Which phase are we in?
- `phases[current_phase].in_progress[0]` → What task are we on?
- `phases[current_phase].next` → What's the next task after this one?
- `progress_metrics.estimated_completion_pct` → How far through the overall plan?

### Step 2: Read Development Log
```
Open and review: MODEL_DEV_LOG.md (last 10 entries)
```

Understand:
- What was completed in the last 1–2 runs?
- What issues or blockers came up?
- Any notes about model structure or quirks?

### Step 3: Inspect Current Phase
Look up the phase details in state file:
```json
"Phase X: Name": {
  "description": "...",
  "completed": [...],
  "in_progress": ["Current task name"],
  "next": "Next task name"
}
```

### Step 4: Assess Model Code
```
Quick scan (2 min):
- git log --oneline -5  (see recent commits)
- ls -la src/ or model/ or similar (see file structure)
- head -20 [main model file] (understand language/framework)
```

---

## EXECUTION: Do the Work (45–90 min)

### Task: Complete the Current `in_progress` Item

**Task:** `{phases[current_phase].in_progress[0]}`

**Phase:** `{current_phase}`

**Description:** `{phases[current_phase].description}`

### Approach

**DO NOT try to do multiple tasks in one cycle.** Pick the ONE task marked `in_progress` and complete it.

- Read existing model files and assumptions
- Make focused, incremental changes
- Add comments explaining changes (especially deviations from SOA/IA standards)
- If model supports it: run basic validation or tests
- Document findings in commit message

### Industry Standards Context

**SOA Standards (Society of Actuaries):**
- Stochastic models must document stochastic process assumptions
- Parameter calibration methodology must be explicit
- Model governance and validation framework required

**IA (Institute of Actuaries):**
- Model documentation, assumptions, sensitivity analysis
- Regular backtest and review cadence
- Clear audit trail of model changes

**ERM (Enterprise Risk Management):**
- Tail risk metrics (VaR, ES) at appropriate confidence levels
- Scenario stress testing
- Model limitations and known issues disclosure

### What Counts as "Complete" for a Task

- ✅ Code written, commented, and tested
- ✅ Validation outputs generated (if applicable)
- ✅ Commit created with detailed message
- ✅ State file updated to mark task as done
- ✅ Next task identified in state file

---

## UPDATE STATE: Mark Progress & Prepare Next (10 min)

### Step 1: Update `.claude-dev/MODEL_DEV_STATE.json`

```json
{
  "last_run": "2026-05-14T12:00:00Z",
  "phases": {
    "Phase X: Name": {
      "completed": [
        "Task 1",
        "Task 2",
        "Task that we just finished"
      ],
      "in_progress": ["Next task name"],
      "next": "Task after that"
    }
  },
  "progress_metrics": {
    "estimated_completion_pct": [calculate based on completed tasks]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Commit Changes

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[Phase X] Task Name: Brief summary

- Detailed accomplishment 1
- Detailed accomplishment 2
- Industry alignment note (SOA/IA standard addressed)
- Next task: [specific task name]

Files: [list changed files]
Status: PASSING (if tests run)
"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Append to MODEL_DEV_LOG.md

```markdown
## Run {timestamp} — Phase X

**Task Completed:** {in_progress task name}

**Accomplishments:**
- Detail 1
- Detail 2

**Next Step:** {next task from state}

**Industry Standards Progress:**
- SOA standard X: {addressed/pending}
- IA requirement Y: {addressed/pending}

## SUMMARY: What Happens Each Cycle

| Step | Duration | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| Load state & context | 2 min | Current task in working memory |
| Inspect model code | 2 min | Understand file structure & history |
| Execute work task | 45–90 min | Code changes, validation, comments |
| Update state file | 5 min | Mark complete, identify next task |
| Commit to GitHub | 3 min | Push with detailed commit message |
| Create Gmail draft | 5 min | Progress report delivered to inbox |
| **Total** | **~60–110 min** | Ready for next cycle in 12 hours |

---

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### If STATE FILE is Invalid JSON
```
Stop. Report error in email.
Do not attempt work.
Wait for manual intervention.
```

### If CURRENT TASK is unclear
```
Review completed[] and in_progress[] arrays.
If both empty, move to next phase.
If still unclear, email with "Manual Review Needed" flag.
```

### If GIT PUSH Fails
```
Report error in email: "GitHub push failed — check credentials"
Changes will be staged locally.
Next cycle will retry.
```

### If YOU manually edit the state file mid-cycle
```
Next scheduled task will pick up new state automatically.
Current work will stop, next cycle starts from new state.
No conflicts expected (state is source of truth).
```

## Phases at a Glance

**Phase 1: Model Review & Documentation**  
Understand what exists. Document assumptions and deviations from standards.

**Phase 2: Industry Standards Alignment**  
Align model components to SOA/IA requirements. Update governance framework.

**Phase 3: Model Validation & Testing**  
Implement unit tests, integration tests, stress testing.

**Phase 4: Calibration & Backtesting**  
Calibrate to historical data. Generate backtest reports.

**Phase 5: Documentation & Delivery**  
Final docs, model card, deployment checklist.

## Key Points for Sustained Autonomous Operation

✅ **State file is the contract:** Always read from `.claude-dev/MODEL_DEV_STATE.json` first  
✅ **Incremental work:** One task per cycle, thoroughly documented  
✅ **Human oversight:** Email drafts keep you informed  
✅ **Self-documenting:** Commit messages + MODEL_DEV_LOG.md = audit trail  
✅ **Resumable:** If manual intervention needed, edit state file and next cycle continues  
✅ **Industry-focused:** Each task includes SOA/IA alignment notes
